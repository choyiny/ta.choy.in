## Tech Stack Ideas
and things that I can help you with. These things may make more sense as you progress
further in the course.

### Kafka
Message broker. It's like "chatrooms" but for the backend. https://kafka.apache.org/ 

### Angular
Frontend framework that is superior to React. You should use any frontend framework
for your project, instead of pure HTML/CSS/JS. https://angular.io/

### Redis
An in memory key value store (basically a fast dictionary, quite similar to memcached). You can also use it as a queue/worker to run tasks. https://redis.io/

### LetsEncrypt
Provision HTTPS certificates for free. You can deploy with this. https://letsencrypt.org/

### PeerJS
WebRTC technology. Initate a peer-to-peer connection with another client. https://peerjs.com/

### Firebase Authentication
Implementing authentication in your application is not going to make it more impressive, so might as well
defer it to an external service to do it for you. https://firebase.google.com/

## Deploying your app(s)
Either Heroku (easy, less marks), or some cloud server such as DigitalOcean, or Google Cloud. You can get a lot of
deployment tools through [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). 
Just link your Github account with your @mail.utoronto.ca email.

### What you can do with the pack:
- Register a domain for free
- Get server hosting credits for free
- Awesome APIs for free
- Testing tools
- much more...


## Some other things
Flask, Ruby on Rails, Docker.
