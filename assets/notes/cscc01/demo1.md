### Marking Rubric for the Sprint 1 class demo
Attendance: 2 marks full team is attending, 1 mark if at least one member not present, 0 marks the whole team not present

_Feedback: Please have all your members arrive on time for the presentation._


Pivotal Tracker: 2 marks if the feature(s) the team is demonstrating are marked as "Finished" on pivotal tracker, 
1 mark if they marked partially finished, 0 marks if pivotal tracker is not updated.

_Feedback: Pivotal features are user stories. Also:_

```
- Login is not a user story.
- Features need to work frontend and backend. (Frontend does not have to look nice!)
```

Working software: 6 marks if features work flawlessly, take away 1 mark for each problem you spot until the mark hits zero.

_Feedback: Please have working code, and all of them aggregated. You are creating one single application,
and not 6 applications. Showing me 6 different screens in 6 different applications is not a working feature._

### Things to note
- Please focus more on backend. Frontend is not the **focus** of this course. Applying the MVC pattern is.
- Login does not add value to your application. Please do not spend too much time on authentication.
- If everyone is creating the same application, see what can make your application unique to others, while still fulfilling requirements!
