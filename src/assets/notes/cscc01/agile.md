### Bad user stories
- As As a user, I want the application to do (everything that it is supposed to do)
- As a user, I want to be able to login
- As a user, I want the application to work on iOS
- As a user, I want the application to work well
- As a user, I want the application UI to be user friendly

### Determining good user stories
#### Questions
- Which ones need to be precise?
- Which ones need to be broken down?
- Which ones are bad user stories?

#### Example app
This report contains the user stories for a system to connect people looking
for a new job with employers having job offers.

#### User Stories
- As Alice, an employer, I would like to post a job offer.
- As Alice, an employer, I would like to get a curated list of all people that
could be good candidates for a job that I have posted so that I can reach
out to them directly
- As Alice, an employer, I would like to get a list of the people that said that
they were interested by the offer so that I can look at their application
- As Bob, a job seeker, I would like to get a list of job offers that match my
profile so that I can apply to them directly
- As Bob, a job seeker, I would like to get statistics about the job market in
my discipline
- As Alice, an employer, I would like the application to be user-friendly
- As Bob, a job seeker, I would like to get a notification when a job offer
corresponding to my profile has been posted
As Bob, a job seeker, I would like the application to work on iOS


## Planning Poker
Goal: Everyone is involved in estimating the difficulty of a user story.
1. Decide on a sequence of values representing "story points". A lot of people use the
fibonacci sequence.
2. Read a user story.
3. Each person decides on a value for that user story based on the difficulty
4. Every person reveals their decision at the same time.
5. If everyone comes up with the same number, that number shall be the story points for the user story.
Else, discuss your choices, and repeat from step 3.
6. Repeat from step 2 for another user story.

*I always treat one story point as half a day of work
