## Practice Scrum by building a Lego city
[Ilir's Handout](/assets/notes/cscc01/tut01.pdf)

_Note: Marks awarded based on participation and attendance._

### Setup
- I don't have LEGO - use something online: [Mecabricks](https://www.mecabricks.com/en/signup)

### Backlog Estimation
- Scrum Poker (1 point -> 1 minute for this simulation)

### Prioritize
You only have 7 minutes per sprint:
- Which stories should be done first?
- Which ones are blocked by other stories?

### Tracking Projects
With **Burndown Charts**
- Provisional Burndown Chart: The plan - how many user stories do you think the team can complete?
- Release Burndown Chart: The actual - how many user stories _did_ the team complete?

X Axis: Duration, normally in days. (1 minute for this simulation)

Y Axis: Story points

### Sprint review
- Present the work to product owner
- Unfinished item goes back to product backlog
- How can we improve the next sprint?

### Debriefing
- What did you observe?
- How did it feel being on a Scrum team?
- How did the short iterations go?
- How accurate were the estimations?
- What would we have done differently from the beginning, if we
had another chance to play the game?
- What was the job of the Product Owner?
- How did it feel after the first sprint when almost all items
required re-work?
- How will your strategy change, if you know the Product Owner is
unavailable during sprints?
- How did inter-team communication go? Were there any
dependencies? How were they resolved?
